# Delta Security Bot

Description as written on top.gg:
The Delta Security Bot is a powerful and proactive Discord moderation tool designed to protect servers from abuse and unauthorized actions. It automatically filters offensive language, removes unnecessary webhooks, monitors role changes, and safeguards specific protected roles from being tampered with by unauthorized users. Additionally, the bot can detect and remove dangerous role permissions, punish offenders by stripping their roles or quarantining them, and even retaliate against users who try to kick the bot itself. With built-in moderation commands like /ban, /kick, and /timeout, alongside an informative /help system, Delta Security Bot ensures a safe and controlled server environment.
